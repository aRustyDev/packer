## Repo Layout
* Development - the working portion of the repo. look here to see what we're working on.
* Docs - Holds any documentation on the different packer files. It runs a bit behind, but it will be updated as we go.
* Operational - These are fully working versions of packer files. You can go in here if you just want something that works.
